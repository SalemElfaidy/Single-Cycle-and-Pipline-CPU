# Single Cycle and Pipline CPU  

 Used Logisim simulator to model and test the processor.
        
## Project Description

❑ Simple 16-bit MIPS-like processor with seven 16-bit general purpose registers: R1 through R7. R0 is hardwired to zero and cannot be written. 

❑ There is also one special-purpose 12-bit register, which is the program counter (PC). 

❑ All instructions are 16 bits and there are three instruction formats: R-type, I-type, and J-type.
